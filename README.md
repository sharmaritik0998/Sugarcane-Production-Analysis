# 🌱 Sugarcane Production Analysis

A data science project to analyze sugarcane production metrics including Yield, Acreage, and Production across different countries and years using Python, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves data cleaning, analysis, and visualization of sugarcane production data. The dataset includes variables such as:

- **Production (Tons)**
- **Production per Person (Kg)**
- **Acreage (Hectare)**
- **Yield (Kg/Hectare)**

Using Python, we explore correlations, trends, and visualize insights that could benefit agricultural policy makers, researchers, and the agri-business sector.
